                    <p class="h4">The story of the game will start with a cinematic scene that shows the launch of the
                        space mission from Earth, followed by a narration that introduces the main characters and their
                        backgrounds, as well as the objectives and challenges of the mission.
                        The scene will then transition to the arrival of the team at the Moon or Mars, depending on the
                        player’s choice, where they will begin to set up their colony and explore their surroundings.
                        The story will then progress through various events and scenarios that will test the player’s
                        skills and decisions, such as encountering aliens, discovering secrets, facing disasters, or
                        competing with other colonizers.
                        The story will end with a final scene that will show the outcome and consequences of the
                        player’s actions and choices, as well as the fate and future of the colony and the team.
                        The ending will vary depending on the player’s performance and preferences, ranging from a
                        successful and prosperous colony, to a failed and abandoned colony, or anything in between.


                        Elements
                        Genre: Science fiction
                        Theme: Survival and exploration in space
                        Plot: The game follows the adventures of a team of space colonizers who are sent on a mission to
                        establish a permanent settlement on the Moon or Mars. The team must overcome various challenges
                        and dangers, such as resource scarcity, environmental hazards, technical malfunctions, and alien
                        encounters. The team must also balance their individual needs and preferences with the common
                        goals and interests of the colony. The game has multiple endings depending on the choices and
                        actions of the players.
                        Characters: The game allows the players to create and customize their own characters, choosing
                        their name, appearance, background, skills, and personality. The game also features several
                        non-player characters (NPCs) who act as allies, enemies, or neutrals. Some of the NPCs are:

                        • Dr. Lee: The leader of the mission and the head of the colony. He is a brilliant scientist and
                        engineer, but also a strict and demanding boss. He is responsible for making the final decisions
                        and ensuring the success of the mission.
                        • Maya: The second-in-command and the communications officer. She is a friendly and charismatic
                        journalist who documents the mission and reports to Earth. She is also the mediator and the
                        morale booster of the team.
                        • Raj: The pilot and the mechanic. He is a skilled and adventurous astronaut who loves to fly
                        and explore. He is also a prankster and a troublemaker who often clashes with Dr. Lee.
                        • Lena: The medic and the biologist. She is a compassionate and caring doctor who takes care of
                        the health and well-being of the team. She is also a curious and passionate researcher who
                        studies the life forms and ecosystems of the Moon and Mars.
                        • Zane: The security and the weapons expert. He is a loyal and brave soldier who protects the
                        team and the colony from external threats. He is also a paranoid and aggressive warrior who
                        distrusts anyone who is not part of the team.

                        World: The game is set in a realistic and futuristic version of the Moon and Mars, based on the
                        latest scientific data and discoveries. The game features various locations and landmarks, such
                        as craters, mountains, valleys, caves, volcanoes, and ancient ruins. The game also introduces
                        some fictional elements, such as alien artifacts, hidden bases, and secret missions. The game
                        aims to create a rich and immersive world that offers both opportunities and challenges
                        for the players.

                                                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to
                                                    support life. It has a diameter of about 12,742 km and a mass of
                                                    about 5.97 x 10^24 kg. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which
                                                    orbits at an average distance of about 384,400 km. Earth has a
                                                    diverse and complex biosphere, with millions of species of plants,
                                                    animals, and microorganisms. Earth also has a dynamic geology, with
                                                    plate tectonics, volcanoes, earthquakes, and erosion. Earth’s
                                                    atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%),
                                                    with traces of other gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapor.
                                                    Earth’s climate is influenced by many factors, such as the Sun’s
                                                    radiation, the greenhouse effect, the ocean currents, and the wind
                                                    patterns. Earth is divided into seven continents and five oceans,
                                                    and has about 200 countries and territories. Earth is home to about
                                                    7.9 billion human beings, who have developed various cultures,
                                                    languages, religions, and technologies.

                                                <p> The Moon is the only natural satellite of Earth and the fifth
                                                    largest moon in the solar system. It has a diameter of about 3,474
                                                    km and a mass of about 7.34 x 10^22 kg. It orbits Earth at an
                                                    average distance of about 384,400 km, with a period of about 27
                                                    days. The Moon has no atmosphere and very little gravity, which
                                                    makes it easy to launch rockets from its surface. The Moon also has
                                                    no magnetic field and is exposed to harsh radiation from the Sun and
                                                    cosmic rays. The Moon’s surface is covered with craters, mountains,
                                                    valleys, and plains, mostly made of silicate rocks and dust. The
                                                    Moon also has some frozen water at its poles and in some deep
                                                    craters. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means it always
                                                    shows the same face to us. The Moon’s phases are caused by its
                                                    position relative to the Sun and Earth. The Moon is the only
                                                    celestial body that humans have visited so far, with 12 astronauts
                                                    landing on its surface between 1969 and 1972.

                                                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet
                                                    in the solar system. It has a diameter of about 6,779 km and a mass
                                                    of about 6.39 x 10^23 kg. It has two natural satellites, Phobos and
                                                    Deimos, which orbit at an average distance of about 9,400 km and
                                                    23,500 km respectively. Mars has a thin atmosphere that is mostly
                                                    made of carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of other gases such as
                                                    nitrogen and argon. Mars has a low surface pressure and temperature,
                                                    which makes it hard to breathe and survive without a spacesuit. Mars
                                                    also has a weak magnetic field and is exposed to strong solar winds
                                                    and radiation. Mars’ surface is mostly red due to iron oxide in its
                                                    soil. Mars has many features that resemble those on Earth, such as
                                                    volcanoes, canyons, valleys, deserts, polar caps, and ancient
                                                    riverbeds. Mars also has evidence of past water activity, such as
                                                    minerals, sediments, ice deposits, and dried-up lakes. Mars is often
                                                    called the Red Planet or the fourth rock from the Sun.

                                                    the solar system. It has a diameter of about 5,149 km and a mass of
                                                    about 1.35 x 10^23 kg. It orbits Saturn at an average distance of
                                                    about 1.2 million km, with a period of about 16 days. Titan has a
                                                    thick atmosphere that is mostly made of nitrogen (97%), with traces
                                                    of methane and other organic compounds. Titan’s atmosphere is so
                                                    dense that it obscures its surface from visible light. Titan also
                                                    has a greenhouse effect that keeps its surface temperature around
                                                    -179 °C. Titan’s surface is covered with lakes and rivers of liquid
                                                    methane and ethane, which are gases on Earth. Titan also has
                                                    mountains, dunes, plains, craters, and cryovolcanoes that spew out
                                                    water ice and ammonia. Titan is the only moon in the solar system
                                                    that has liquid on its surface and clouds in its sky. Titan is often
                                                    called Saturn’s mysterious moon or the mini-Earth.
